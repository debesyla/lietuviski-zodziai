# Dažniausi lietuviški žodžiai

A static SvelteKit application for exploring Lithuanian word-frequency lists.
It loads one catalog-selected dataset at a time, then offers filters, a
frequency dashboard, a paginated table, and a faithful CSV export.

The browser catalog includes reviewed Lithuanian lemma-frequency datasets. Their
source licences and citations are shown in the app and preserved in dataset
metadata; larger products are explained in the public catalogue at
`/duomenu-katalogas` and remain available through the public JSON catalog.

## What the app does

- Select a curated dataset from `static/datasets/catalog.json`.
- Inspect headline totals, top words, rank/frequency, cumulative coverage, and
  source-provided part-of-speech composition.
- Explore DML6 dictionary coverage across transparent JCL frequency bands,
  with separate form and token shares plus bounded example lists.
- Compare an exact word form across CCLL2, wartime media, and wartime social
  networks without loading the full 2.26-million-row comparison dataset.
- Look up one exact wordform across the five named CCLL subcorpora at
  `/zanru-profilis`, with raw counts, source denominators, and per-million
  rates but no aggregate-plus-genre total or generic genre leaderboard.
- Look up one lower-cased exact BLKT wordform at `/blkt-profilis`, with
  aggregate counts and per-million rates for the whole corpus and, when the
  disclosure rules allow them, five broad document types and four periods.
  The lookup publishes no raw text or document identity data and fetches at
  most one bounded data chunk for a query.
- Search, filter by part of speech, sort by word/frequency/type, and browse a
  50-row page at a time.
- Export the complete active filtered and sorted result set as UTF-8 CSV.
- Explore bounded dependency-relation and sentence contexts from the ALKSNIS
  v3.0 syntactic treebank at `/sintakse`.
- Browse every public data product by source scope, licence, access, and
  interpretation limit at `/duomenu-katalogas`.

## Development

Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Run the same checks used for pull requests and a self-hosted release:

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit # once per machine
npm run test:browser
npm run products:verify
npm run public:verify
npm run build
```

Build and launch the production version locally:

```bash
npm start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`. The repeatable browser-release matrix and
hosted-site sign-off steps are in
[docs/browser-acceptance.md](docs/browser-acceptance.md); use the
[release-record template](docs/release-record.md) for the final go/no-go
decision.

Production is deployed to `https://dago.lt/zodziai/` over SSH after changes
land on `main`. The Hostinger directory marker, GitHub environment secrets,
and first-deployment steps are documented in
[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).

## Dataset maintenance

Datasets are prepared rarely by a maintainer, not uploaded through the public
app. The canonical schema, source configuration, validation rules, and command
are in [docs/data-preparation.md](docs/data-preparation.md). Approved source
decisions and externally gated research candidates are tracked separately in
[docs/source-catalog.md](docs/source-catalog.md), so a known source is not
mistaken for an authorized public product.
Larger and non-generic collections have implementation-ready source contracts in
[docs/source-contracts.md](docs/source-contracts.md). The complete public JSON
delivery model is documented in [docs/data-products.md](docs/data-products.md).
The BLKT profile is built from the pinned source snapshot only after the
project owner's permission to publish derived aggregates and datasets has been
recorded; its separate preparation and disclosure rules are described in those
two documents. The source contains two verified licence groups: 8,267,437
NewGenLTU OpenRAIL-D rows and 170,718 `Vikipedija` rows under CC BY-SA 4.0.
The generated product carries both complete licence texts, both attributions,
and a prominent modification notice. BLKT is not representative of all
Lithuanian language use because media and document texts dominate its document
and token composition.

```bash
npm run data:build -- --config data/datasets/utka-2018-lemmatized-totals.json --source-root /path/to/reviewed-source-root --output static/datasets/utka-2018-lemmatized-totals.json --catalog static/datasets/catalog.json
npm run data:verify -- --source-root /path/to/reviewed-source-root
npm run source:verify -- --source-root /path/to/reviewed-source-root
npm run products:build -- --source-root /path/to/reviewed-source-root
npm run products:verify
npm run public:verify
```

Review provenance, licence, citation, source snapshot, summary totals, and the
generated catalog entry before committing a new dataset. `products:build`
recreates the checked-in `static/data-products/` artifacts from the pinned
raw-source snapshot; stage those regenerated JSON files together with their
contract change. `products:verify` checks every generated manifest and chunk.
The table's large-list strategy is documented in [docs/scalable-exploration.md](docs/scalable-exploration.md).
The evidence-based plan for future statistical and contextual explorations is in
[docs/statistical-exploration-roadmap.md](docs/statistical-exploration-roadmap.md).
The public visual and interaction baseline is documented in
[docs/design-system.md](docs/design-system.md).

## Local launch and self-hosting

The default production build is portable and uses the domain root:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The complete static site is written to `build/`. A future server can publish
that directory directly. Configure the public URL at build time so canonical,
social-preview, sitemap, and robots metadata point to the real host:

```bash
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://zodziai.example.lt npm run build
```

If the server exposes the site below a path rather than at the domain root,
configure both values and include the path in the public URL:

```bash
BASE_PATH=/lietuviu-zodziai PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.lt/lietuviu-zodziai npm run build
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for persistent local build settings. The static
server must resolve extensionless routes such as `/apie` to the generated
`apie.html`; `npm run preview` already does this.

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run the verification workflow in
`.github/workflows/verify.yml`. The checked-in public data products are
verified before a release build and copied unchanged into the static site.
Maintainers rebuild them locally from the reviewed source root before updating
a product.

## Analytics and privacy

The application contains no analytics, tracking script, referrer collection, or
browser-storage telemetry. The static host may still have its own operational
logs under its service terms.

## Licence

The application code is available under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Individual
datasets retain the licences and attribution recorded in their provenance;
those terms can differ from the code licence.
