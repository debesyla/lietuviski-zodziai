# Public data products

Every maintained collection has a public JSON product. The compact catalog is
published at `data-products/catalog.json` on the site. It points to one
`manifest.json` per collection; a manifest then either points to the existing
generic dataset JSON or to a set of independently fetchable chunk indexes.
Visitors can browse the same products, their source scope, licence, access, and
interpretation limits at `/duomenu-katalogas` before following a JSON link.

The generated files live under `static/data-products/` and are checked in with
the application. This keeps the static deployment self-contained: the
site publishes the exact reviewed JSON artifacts without requiring the raw
source at deploy time. The public manifests preserve safe content-bound
artifact IDs, byte counts, checksums, source URL, licence, and citation; they
never disclose internal source locations or revisions.

## Build and verify

```bash
npm run products:build -- --source-root /path/to/reviewed-source-root
npm run products:verify
npm run public:verify
```

`products:build` first runs the byte-level source-contract verifier. It then
replaces only `static/data-products/`, creates all manifests, view indexes, and
chunks, and keeps content-bound source artifact IDs, checksums, source URL,
licence, and citation in public provenance. Stage the regenerated files when
the reviewed source changes. `products:verify` re-reads every generated JSON file, checks
every chunk checksum and byte size, validates every record shape, recomputes
totals and null counts, and confirms that metadata-only products do not contain
rows. `public:verify` rejects internal locator fields and unsafe public
provenance before release; it also runs the BLKT disclosure quarantine, which
rejects extra files or keys, raw-text/identity fields, crossed dimensions,
threshold failures, partial-family disclosure, and payloads over 64 KiB.

Use `--output`, `--static-root`, `--plan`, or `--contract` only for an isolated
review or test build. The normal command has no hard-coded local source path.

## Product shapes

| Product type | Data location | Row form | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `generic-frequency-dataset` | Existing `static/datasets/*.json` file | Objects with `word`, optional `type`, and `frequency` | Browser-selectable reviewed frequency datasets. |
| `chunked-wordform-list` | Manifest → view `index.json` → chunk files | Arrays; field order is declared in the index | Raw token counts for the CCLL aggregate or one named subcorpus. |
| `chunked-frequency-list` | Manifest → view `index.json` → chunk files | Arrays; field order is declared in the index | A complete raw frequency list too large for the browser selector, such as the Delfi.lt one-gram list. |
| `chunked-derived-frequency-list` | Manifest → view `index.json` → chunk files | Arrays; field order is declared in the index | A reproducible aggregation from an annotated source. Derived fields are explicitly marked in the index. |
| `chunked-lexical-collection` | Manifest → view `index.json` → chunk files | Arrays; field order is declared in the index | A source-specific lexical collection whose fields must not be collapsed into a generic frequency column. |
| `chunked-syntactic-context` | Manifest → compact summaries, prefix-indexed lemma and context chunks | Arrays; field order and prefix selection are declared in each index | Source-scoped dependency relations and sentence contexts, where the browser fetches a lemma index and sentence examples only after a visitor asks for them. |
| `chunked-comparison` | Manifest → view `index.json` → chunk files | Arrays; field order is declared in the index | Comparison measures whose meaning cannot safely be represented by a generic frequency field. |
| `metadata-only` | Manifest only | No rows | Source inventory and publication decision for a collection whose rows cannot yet be redistributed. |

Each chunk is self-identifying JSON:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "productId": "example",
  "viewId": "example-view",
  "chunk": 0,
  "records": [["word", 42]]
}
```

The corresponding index supplies field metadata, source-file snapshot, order,
row count, numeric totals, null counts, maximum chunk bytes, and a SHA-256
descriptor for every chunk. Consumers must use that field list instead of
assuming the second value is a generic frequency.

## Compact analytical profiles

A comparison manifest can additionally list an `analysisProfiles` entry. Each
profile has its own small manifest and preserves the source view, source-file
checksum, category labels, frequency-band definitions, totals, delivery
budget, and SHA-256 descriptor for every optional drill-down file. The summary
loads without comparison chunks; a browser requests a bounded drill-down only
after a visitor selects a band and category.

The first profile is
`dadurkevicius-dml6-vs-jcl-comparison/analysis/dml6-jcl-coverage-by-frequency-band/`.
It groups JCL wordforms into the documented intervals `1`, `2–4`, `5–9`,
`10–99`, `100–999`, and `1,000+`. Every interval keeps the DML6 coverage code
as a labelled category, exposes form counts and JCL token counts separately,
and contains at most 50 frequency-ordered examples per category. It is not a
generic frequency view and must not turn a coverage code into a numeric score.

`utka-ccll2-war-ukraine-comparison/analysis/ccll2-wartime-normalized-contrast/`
is a bounded exact-form lookup profile. Its compact routing manifest sends a
query to one lookup bucket containing normalized form and source-row pointers,
then the browser requests only the one or two existing source chunks needed to
show the six source metrics. The lookup buckets deliberately do not duplicate
the metrics. The profile preserves all token/document denominators, raw null
counts, a 100-per-100-million minimum-rate rule, and the formula
`log2(numeratorRate / denominatorRate)`. Duplicate normalized forms are not
summed: compatible sparse source rows are combined only when a visitor asks for
that form, while contradictory values are rejected.

`utka-ccll-wordforms/analysis/ccll-wordform-genre-profile/` is a separate,
source-scoped exact wordform lookup across the five named CCLL subcorpora. Its
small profile manifest points only to a root routing node; routing nodes and
packed lookup buckets are each capped at 64 KiB. A selected record stores the
source wordform, five nullable raw counts, and the number of named subcorpora
where it was observed. The browser derives a per-million rate from each
published source-token denominator; a small worker parses and scans the
selected bucket off the main thread. It never adds the aggregate list, turns a
missing value into zero, filters punctuation, or exposes a universal
genre-signal leaderboard.

`vssa-2026-blkt-wordform-profile` is a separate privacy-safe exact-wordform
product rather than a generic frequency list. Its compact root index carries
ordered ranges for bounded routing pages; the selected routing page carries
the first and last key for each data chunk in that range. A query at
`/blkt-profilis` fetches one routing page and at most one data chunk, each
capped at 64 KiB, and then performs an exact lookup. It never downloads the
complete profile or exposes a browseable word leaderboard.

Each eligible word has non-null corpus token and document counts. Its five
document-type pairs and four period pairs are either all present within their
family or all `null`. A positive value is publishable only with at least 100
tokens and support from at least 20 document rows; if one positive sibling
misses either threshold, the complete family is suppressed. An absent lookup
and a threshold-suppressed word produce the same public no-result response.
Rates per million are calculated in the browser from the published count and
the matching derived-token denominator.

The pinned source audit records 8,267,437 NewGenLTU OpenRAIL-D rows
(3,906,734,476 source alpha words) and 170,718 `Vikipedija` rows under CC BY-SA
4.0 (34,741,743 source alpha words). Every generated BLKT JSON file carries a
compact attribution and modification notice. The product root includes the
complete NewGenLTU licence, including Attachment A, and the complete CC BY-SA
4.0 legal code; selected-result downloads embed both terms. These counts do not
make BLKT representative of all Lithuanian: media and document texts dominate
its composition.

## Published collection coverage

- `utka-2018-lemmatized-totals`, `dadurkevicius-2020-jcl-lemmas`, and
  `petkevicius-2025-ccll-lemmas` remain complete direct JSON datasets.
- `utka-ccll-wordforms` has seven bounded JSON views: aggregate frequency and
  alphabetical orders plus five named subcorpora. The aggregate is never added
  to the subcorpora. Its genre-profile lookup joins only the five named lists,
  retains raw counts and denominators separately, and loads a route plus one
  bounded bucket for an exact form at `/zanru-profilis`.
- `dadurkevicius-dml6-vs-jcl-comparison` has separate views for type coverage,
  lemma/POS occurrences, and types missing in DML6. Coverage codes are labelled
  categories, not counts. Its compact frequency-band coverage profile powers
  the public dictionary-coverage explorer without downloading the 4.97-million
  row comparison view.
- `utka-ccll2-war-ukraine-comparison` keeps all six normalized token/document
  metrics separate. Source absence is JSON `null`, not zero. Its routed
  analytical profile supports an on-demand word-form comparison without loading
  the 2.26-million-row source view.
- `kapociute-dzikiene-2017-parliament-frequency-aggregates` publishes separate
  corpus-wide wordform and lemma totals from a legislative-speech corpus. It
  contains no text, quotations, document rows, calendar bins, source IDs,
  speaker or author data, or rankings; its counts are not general Lithuanian
  frequency claims.
- `vssa-2026-blkt-wordform-profile` publishes thresholded aggregate wordform
  counts for the whole BLKT and eligible type/period families. Its tokenizer
  extracts maximal Unicode-letter sequences from NFC text, lower-cases and
  NFC-normalizes them, and excludes forms over 64 code points. It publishes no
  raw text, document identities, subtypes, crossed type-by-period cells, or
  personal data. Owner-confirmed project-specific permission covers publishing
  these BLKT-derived aggregates and datasets. Its mixed NewGenLTU/CC BY-SA
  source inventory, full licence copies, VSSA and Wikipedia-contributor
  attributions, and modification notice are retained with the product. Media
  and document texts dominate BLKT, so its counts are not representative of all
  Lithuanian language use.
- `bielinskiene-2019-delfi-1grams` publishes all 1,030,562 raw one-gram rows
  in bounded chunks. Its counts are not lemma frequencies.
- `rimkute-2024-matas-v3-frequencies` derives separate lemma/POS and
  wordform/POS views from CoNLL-U. Punctuation is excluded and a missing
  source POS is labelled `UNSPECIFIED`.
- `zemriete-2025-lithuanian-homoforms` publishes every homoform analysis with
  separate MATAS and component counts in source order.
- `raskinis-2025-foreign-name-transliterations` publishes every source name
  pair and match count, without inferring a canonical direction or spelling.
- `birvinskaite-2026-lithuanian-basketball-slang` publishes every parsed NVH
  lexical entry with nested source and sense evidence; it is not frequency
  data, and its 223 stored-file entries remain distinct from the record page's
  233-entry claim.
- `rimkute-2019-alksnis-syntactic-context` publishes ALKSNIS v3.0 relation and
  genre totals, a complete non-punctuation lemma index, and capped source
  sentence contexts. It preserves dependency direction, relation, document,
  genre, and sentence identifier; it is not a general frequency ranking or a
  similarity product.
- `rimkute-morphemic-dictionary` publishes the reviewed source-order entries
  deterministically extracted from the three pinned 2011 PDF volumes. Each row
  keeps the source wordform, corpus-scoped frequency, morphemic analysis,
  combined lemma-and-morphology text, volume, and printed page. The three PDF
  volumes yield 72,325 rows with a source-frequency total of 310,012. That PDF
  snapshot has 61 more rows than the 72,264 entries reported by the later live
  Morfema database; the live count is contextual only, not an extraction target
  or verification oracle. Rightsholder
  permission covers extraction and correction, complete derivative and
  statistics publication and redistribution, and downstream reuse with normal
  attribution. The public provenance records that permission without exposing
  private correspondence and identifies the files as a modified PDF
  derivative, not an export of the separate live Morfema database.

The full public decision table is in [source-catalog.md](source-catalog.md),
and the fixed raw-source inventory is in
[source-contracts.md](source-contracts.md).

## ALKSNIS syntax-context delivery

ALKSNIS v3.0 is a small, manually reviewed syntactic treebank. Its product
starts with a compact manifest carrying corpus totals, relation/genre view
locations, the observed sentence-ID count, and the repository's different
sentence claim. The repository says 3,643 sentences; the delivered CoNLL-U
members contain 3,642 `sent_id` values. Both numbers remain visible rather
than being silently reconciled.

The relation and genre summaries are small static views. Lemma-index chunks
are selected by the first lower-cased source-lemma code point; sentence-context
chunks use the first three while small adjacent prefix groups are packed into
the same bounded file. A visitor therefore fetches neither the whole
treebank nor its context rows until they submit a lookup and choose a concrete
lemma. Every context row retains the selected lemma's role (`dependent`,
`head`, or `root`), the source relation label, both sides of the relation,
genre, source CoNLL-U document, source sentence identifier, and sentence text.

Punctuation (`UPOS=PUNCT`) is excluded from the public lemma index, relation
summary, and contexts. A source root stays explicit as `HEAD=0` / `ROOT`.
Contexts are capped at 12 per lemma in archive-member, sentence, and token
source order; the manifest declares how many otherwise eligible context rows
were omitted by that delivery limit. These choices make the feature navigable
without turning a finite source sample into unsupported claims about Lithuanian
syntax, synonymy, or genre significance.
